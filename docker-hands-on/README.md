# A Quick Docker Hands-on

## Objective

As a cloud engineer, I want to complete a quick refresher course on how to use Docker with Visual Studio Code and, ideally, Terraform.  

To this end, I'll look for a "mini project" or meaningful tutorial(s) to serve as self-study resources.

## Docker Via the Terminal (Visual Studio Code)

- [Get started with Docker remote containers on WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers)
  - I want to make sure that I can work with Docker containers under WSL using VS Code
    - I'm currently running WSL 1 and it looks like I'll need to switch to running WSL 2 to get support for Docker...
- [Tutorial: Create and share a Docker app with Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/docker/tutorials/docker-tutorial)
- [Use a Docker container as a development environment with Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/)
- [A crash course on Docker - Ramp up on Docker in minutes via a lightning quick, hands-on crash course where you learn by doing](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-crash-course-on-docker-34073b9e1833)
