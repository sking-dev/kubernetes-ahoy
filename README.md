# Kubernetes Ahoy

![Kubernetes logo](kubernetes-logo.jpg)

----

This project is for getting to grips with Kubernetes and containerisation.

----

## What is Kubernetes?  

Is it "an opinionated automation platform"?  

A "suite of things"?

Something else entirely?

## What Does Kubernetes Do?  

AKA "What does Kubernetes do best?"

## How Can I Get to Grips with Kubernetes?  

As a first move, skill up in Linux and container fundamentals.

E.g. what's the use case(s) for containers?

### Secondary Sources

Caveat: many of the links below have been added on the basis of, "hmmm, this could be useful one of these days..."  As I work my way through them, I'll promote any that I find especially useful to "Primary Sources", add a comment to any that I think are (still) valid "Secondary Sources", and get rid of any that don't, as they say, cut the mustard (albeit imho..!)
