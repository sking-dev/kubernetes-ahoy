----

This project is for getting to grips with Kubernetes and containerisation.

----

## What is Kubernetes?  

Is it "an opinionated automation platform"?  A "suite of things"?  (I think I made that one up!)

## What Does Kubernetes Do?  

AKA "What does Kubernetes do best?"

## How Can I Get to Grips with Kubernetes?  

As a first move, skill up in Linux and container fundamentals e.g. what's the use case(s) for containers?
